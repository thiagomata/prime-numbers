# SpecDerivedBySurvivors — Value-Level Survivor Proof

**Created:** 2026-07-04
**Updated:** 2026-07-04
**Status:** Ticket created, first lemma planned.

## START HERE

### Goal

Create a new class `SpecDerivedBySurvivors` that wraps `SpecDerivedSieveSequence` and builds the survivor-to-next-stage equivalence proof using the **value-level approach** (coprimality chains, `passesFilter` instead of `accepts`, no index-based `nextAcceptedOldIndex` machinery). This is the "NEW APPROACH: SieveCycleAfterProof" path described in `independent-next-cycle.md` §C.1.1, restarted cleanly in its own class.

### Why a new class instead of the contract migration

- Does NOT modify any existing verified code
- Does NOT need the 9-function coupled require migration (which broke HEAD before)
- Builds incrementally, one lemma per verify cycle
- Reuses existing verified lemmas (`assertNextHeadMatches`, `assertCycleValueCoprimeToTail`, etc.)

### Architecture

```
SpecDerivedBySurvivors(derived: SpecDerivedSieveSequence)
  └── derived.spec, derived.cycle, derived.period  (delegated)
  └── Lemma chain:
        assertFirstSurvivorEqualsSpecNextHead()
        assertCycleSurvivorCoprimeToCyclePrimes(pos)
        assertSpecNextFilterEqCyclePrimes()
        assertCycleSurvivorCoprimeToSpecNextFilter(pos)
        assertCycleSurvivorPassesSpecNextFilter(pos)
        ──→ (future: ordered survivor equality, gap equality, rotation equality)
```

Each lemma reuses existing verified methods from `SpecDerivedSieveSequence`, adding value-level reasoning on top.

### Current state

Green: `12012 valid: 0 invalid: 0 unknown`

### Next micro-goal

**Lemma:** `assertFirstSurvivorEqualsSpecNextHead()` in `SpecDerivedBySurvivors`
- Statement: `cycle.integral(0) == spec.next.head.value`
- Preconditions: none beyond constructor requires
- Proof: `assertNextHeadMatches()` gives `cycle(1) == spec.next.head.value`; by definition of `CycleSieveSequence.apply`, `cycle(1) == cycle.integral(0)`
- Why it's first: simplest lemma, no new groundwork needed, validates the class wiring in one cycle

## Progress Log

### 2026-07-04 — Ticket created

- Green baseline: 12012 valid, 0 invalid, 0 unknown
- First micro-goal planned: `assertCycleSurvivorCoprimeToCyclePrimes(pos)` in new class `SpecDerivedBySurvivors`
- Reference: article `sieve-sequence.md` §C.1.1 documents the value-level approach
- Reference: `independent-next-cycle.md` §"NEW APPROACH: SieveCycleAfterProof" (5 commented-out lemmas)
- Reference: OBJECTS.md §6.6 for existing `SpecDerivedSieveSequence` lemmas

### 2026-07-04 — Lemma 1 verified

- Created `SpecDerivedBySurvivors.scala` (wraps `SpecDerivedSieveSequence`)
- Added `assertCycleSurvivorCoprimeToCyclePrimes(pos)` — verified 8/8
- Full chapter: 12020 valid, 0 invalid, 0 unknown (no regressions)
- Key discovery: no new groundwork needed — `primeValues` `.ensuring` already proves `result.head == primes.head.value`, and `checkAllPositive` delegates to `allGreaterThan`
- `assertFirstSurvivorEqualsSpecNextHead` would have duplicated existing `assertFirstSurvivorEqualsSpecNext0()` in SpecDerivedSieveSequence — skipped it
- OBJECTS.md updated with new §6.9 entry, ch6 count bumped from 214→215

## Lessons Learned

- **Don't plan duplicates first**: Check what's already proved in lower-chapter objects before planning new lemmas
- **`.ensuring` on `primeValues` covers the head equality need**: No new lemma in PrimeUtils was needed for `cyclePrimes.head == spec.head.value`
- **Value-level approach works**: the coprimality chain lemma verified (8/8 in 11.97s) — the basic approach is sound and fast
- **Next lemma**: `assertSpecNextFilterEqCyclePrimes()` to show `spec.next.filterValues == cyclePrimes`
